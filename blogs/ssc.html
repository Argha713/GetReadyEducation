                                In education, an examination just tests to show the knowledge and ability of a student, and it is not the scorecard of a person's personality. But it is necessary to take examinations for a cross-check whether our learning is going in the right direction or not. So, in this article, I will be putting light on the examination which is held nation-wide,  <a href="https://www.edubull.com/exams/ssc-exams" target="_blank">SSC (Staff Selection Commission) exams</a>. Around 10 lakhs of candidates appear each year for various SSC exams.
